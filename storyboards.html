      <p>For both of these storyboards, my partner and I tried to depict the storyline of a person with a mental illness choosing to use our website or app in order to feel better when in a tough situation. For example, an individual could be feeling depressed, saddened, anxious, or any other possible mental illness and choose to log and record how they are feeling when they are feeling it. This website we aim to help those individuals who may not want to or feel comfortable talking to a therapist or other professional. On this website they can also keep their personal issues in confidence while also having an outlet to control their feelings and thoughts. A person could access this website in app form due to responsive design. They could access this on their phone or laptop and use it wherever they are. Those with mental illnesses can log their video recordings, see their progress with a chart, and can also receive uplifting messages each day (depending on the illness). They will later receive satisfaction after recording and submitting their thoughts and feelings onto their profile account. Individuals are motivated to use this product for health reasons and for a way to outlet and release built up emotions without taking it out on anyone else. It feels the need of having someone to talk to, sometimes people do not want to share every bit of their life, or maybe someone is not available, or not comfortable with a health specialist/therapist, or not comfortable enough to share witht their friends. </p>
