      <p>For both of these storyboards, my partner and I tried to depict the storyline of a person with a mental illness choosing to use our website or app in order to feel better when in a tough situation. For example, an individual could be feeling depressed, saddened, anxious, or any other possible mental illness and choose to log and record <em>how</em> they are feeling <em> when </em> they are feeling it. This website we aim to help those individuals who may not want to or feel comfortable talking to a therapist or other professional. On this website they can also keep their personal issues in confidence while also having an outlet to control their feelings and thoughts. </p>
