      <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <h2>Topic Summary </h2>
    <p>For this project, we aim to provide a place where individuals with mental illnesses could find solace. Sometimes, especially for college students, life can get really overwhelming. There are a variety of mental illnesses in the world, but we wanted
      to tailor this particular website to those with anxiety. We decided on this particular illness because it is something that a majority of college students often experience in the day to day life of courses, responsibilities, and deadlines. As each
      generation becomes more and more competitive, it is harder to find a time where students can unwind and have fun. “It is a natural and important emotion, signaling through stirrings of worry, fearfulness, and alarm that danger or a sudden, threatening
      change is near. Yet sometimes anxiety becomes an exaggerated, unhealthy response.” It seems that everyone is worried about their future and school has become an unhealthy responsibility amongst the rest of the gifts that life gives us in our prime.
      With this website; students, millenials, and other adolescents can come to this website and use it according to their needs. Depending on their level of anxiety, they are able to log that, and then record themselves using speech recognition- similar
      to a journal. This acts as an alternative to those who are uncomfortable sharing their problems with a stranger like a therapist, or bomboarding their friends and family with things they may not understand. The site will not only act as a journal,
      but users can also choose to sign up for daily uplifting reminders in order to calm them or help them each day. We also hoped to add a soothing soundtrack in order to help calm nervousness, and any other symptoms of anxiety. </<p>
      <h2> Target Audience</h2>
      <p> The target audience, as explained in the topic summary, are college students. This website would not cost money, therefore students will not have to worry about financial burden. For the education level, it does not matter as long as he or she understands
        how to use the internet. Students will be able to have access to their profile 24/7 as responsive design gives way to mobile device usage. Individuals using this website want to get better, or at least have an outlet where they are comfortable
        enough to share. In some instances, in the feeling of anxiety it may seem like they are alone in their fears and worries. This can serve as a platform where students can express how they are feeling and when they are feeling it. This will help
        them track when and why they were anxious and then later on be able to see how the outcome was and where they can improve for the next episode or time of anxiety. </p>
      <h2>Goals of the Project </h2>
      <p>The goal of this project is to tailor specifically to college students because, as college students, we are often in the state of anxiety and fear. This may be caused by many aspects of the college life, but some of them may include the pressure
        grades, social situations, time management, success, and other things that may be hindering the already busy life of a student. We hope to bring a platform in which students could find solace and comfort instead of keeping it to themselves and
        getting worse. This could act as a somewhat self therapy. </p>
      <h2>Communication Strategy </h2>
      <p>The communications strategy we plan to use is through a journal type form, with a playlist available for soothing, and a graph that can be implemented for progress reports. User will also have access to the option of opting for daily reminders or
        quotes that are positive and uplifting. </p>
      <h2>Goals for Overall Look and Feel </h2>
      <p>For the overall look and feel of the website, we plan to use cool, calming colors that act as a calming agent as well. Cooler, calmer, and pastel colors are more calming than brighter warmer colors. Colors like blue, are helpful in calming someone
        down, and reducing the feeling of nervousness, nauseousness, fear, and other emotions. </p>
