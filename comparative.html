<h2> Handihelp.net </h2>

<p>For this website, it helps individuals or family members gain knowledge about programs for those with disabilities. This is a good site because it helps people find places in which they can gain help at a specific area. This way, they can get to know others with the same disabilities. There is familiarity in this program. There is a grouping of great websites that are recommended for health, places with the same language, caregivers, and different types of care that families may prefer. The left side shows tabs for other information that a person with a disability might want to know for example health rights, social services, health insurance, and research. This allows for the individual to be fully knowledgable about their situation. This site is helpful in tailoring needs for people at one specific place, but not for other places where they can learn and feel more comfortable. </p>

<h2> Do It </h2>

<p>On this Pinterest page, it shows different ways in which a family or person can make their homes handicap accessible. There are the do’s and don’ts included on this page and visuals that make it easier for a person to understand. This site is helpful in ways that a person may find things or places around the home that may make it harder for a handicap person to get around. A handicap person has a harder time being mobile and usually requires assistance from a person that is around a lot of the time. This may be a burden or give a feeling of dependency or embarrassment for the handicap individual. When a place is easier to get around, or allows the individual to do thins by his or herself, it creates a more independent environment.</p>

<h2> Handihelper <h2>
  <p>Both of these websites are helpful in giving information on how to hep handicap individuals in concentrated areas and maybe for other areas or homes, but what I had in mind was an application that handicap individuals could have easy accessibility to, like on their phone, where they could look up places that ARE handicap accessible. This way, they do not have the trouble of wondering if this restaurant, store, public transportation, or car is handicap accessible. All this information would be at their fingertips, and they do not have to do much research. All the places that label themselves as handicap accessible would be displayed and registered to this application.</p>
