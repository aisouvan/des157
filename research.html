  <h2> "Persons With Disabilities as an Unrecognized Health Disparity Population" </h2>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4355692/"> Click Here for Article I </a>
  <p>This article explains the unrecognized knowledgeof how many people actually have a disability. The article explains that "Disability is an emerging field within public health; people with significant disabilities account for more than 12% of the US population." The acknowledgment of handicapped individuals is not recognized as much as it should be. Handicap accessible areas prove to be a difficult amenity that is hard to come by. Not being able to go out, or traveling to places that you would like because of the lack of handicap accessibility is something that these individuals have to endure every day.Not only to disabled persons have difficulty doing things in their daily life they are also discriminated against and not offered the same opportunities as those without disabilities. There have been different ideas and definitions of disabilities that may not always end in someone in a wheelchair. Other disabilities include:
  <br>
  1. deafness or serious difficulty in hearing (all ages);
  2. blindness or serious difficulty in seeing (all ages);
  3. serious difficulty in concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition (5 years or older);
  4. serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs (5 years or older);
  5. difficulty dressing or bathing (5 years or older); and
  6. difficulty doing errands alone (e.g., visiting a doctor’s office or shopping) because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition (15 years or older). </br>

  <h2> "Schools Make Adjustments To Comply With Updated Standards To Make Campuses More Accessible to the Disabled" </h2>
  <a href="http://diverseeducation.com/article/51840/"> Click Here for Article II </a>
  <p>This article focuses on the ways in which schools can improve their structure so that disabled students can maneuver around campus easily. The article states:
  <br>
"One reason the 1991 regulations and standards were revised was to add precise features that eliminate confusion and ensure consistency for everybody trying to comply. For example, many of the modifications apply to restrooms. These revisions include specifying the highest and lowest points a person has to extend his or her arms to use fixtures and accessories, as well as increasing the clear floor space required in a toilet stall to allow someone in a wheelchair to maneuver.

In addition, the earliest standards were based on adult dimensions and did not consider requirements for children and people of short stature at places such as drinking fountains, restrooms and sinks. The most recent standards lower the “reach range” requirements for mechanisms including light switches and thermostats from 54 inches in the 1991 standards to 48 inches. They take into account people of shorter height, along with those with limited upper-body strength and diminished use of the arms or fingers."
</br>
This not only lets the students who encounter these issues in their daily life easier, but it makes them feel included. Many things on campus can be exclusive to persons with disabilities that leave individuals out. These changes also contribute to a safer environment for students with disabilities. This helps with safety because then students would not have to do any dangerous things in order to get somewhere <em> because </em> there are no options for safer routes. </p>

  <h2> My Hopes </h2>
  <a href="http://www.wheelingcalscoast.org/"> Somewhat similar to my Idea, but not in App form </a>
    <p>Both of these websites are helpful in giving information on how to hep handicap individuals in concentrated areas and maybe for other areas or homes, but what I had in mind was an application that handicap individuals could have easy accessibility to, like on their phone, where they could look up places that ARE handicap accessible. This way, they do not have the trouble of wondering if this restaurant, store, public transportation, or car is handicap accessible. All this information would be at their fingertips, and they do not have to do much research. All the places that label themselves as handicap accessible would be displayed and registered to this application.</p>
